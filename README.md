# Time-Series-Forecasting-Personal-Project

## Overview
This project focuses on using time series forecasting to predict mile race times based on my running data.

## Goal
The goal is to build models that can estimate future performance using past race results.

## Current Progress
- Organized race data
- Converting times to seconds
- Learning time series concepts (trend, seasonality, noise)
- Planning to implement ARIMA as a baseline model

## Next Steps
- Clean and structure dataset
- Build ARIMA model
- Evaluate prediction accuracy
